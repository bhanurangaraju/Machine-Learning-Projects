This program illustrates the performance metrics of the popular machine learning algorithms in predicting the heart disease based on the given heart database.

We have four algorithms named as:
Linear regression 
Logistic regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Naïve Bayes Classifier.

Each of them are implemented on the heart.txt file by executing the program file “AccuracyAnalysis.m”.
Now two graphs are plotted where figure 1 demonstrates accuracy of each algorithm for 10 randomized iterations and figure 2 demonstrates time elapsed for execution of each algorithm for 10 randomized iterations.
